# ðŸŽ“ GregMatOR

**GregMatOR** is an AI-powered web app that generates GRE Verbal questions (like Sentence Equivalence and Text Completion) in real time. You just click a button â€” it gives you a question with options, and once you answer, it explains everything.

I built this as a side project while preparing for the GRE using GregMat. It's open source and free for anyone to use.
